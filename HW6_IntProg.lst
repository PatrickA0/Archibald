      Chapter 7 Problem #1
       
      A farmer plans to develop water for irrigation. He is considering two possible sources of
      water: a gravity diversion from a possible reservoir with two alternative capacities and/or a
      pump from a lower river diversion (refer to Figure 7.3). Between the reservoir and pump
      site the river base flow increases by 2 acft/day due to groundwater drainage into the river.
      Ignore losses from the reservoir. The river flow into the reservoir and the farmer's demand
      during each of two six-month seasons of the year are given in Table 7.5. Revenue is estimated
      at $300 per year per acre irrigated.
       
      Assume that there are only two possible sizes of reservoir: a high dam that has capacity of
      700 acft or a low dam with capacity of 300 acft. The capital costs are $10,000/year and
      $6,000/year for the high and low dams, respectively (no operating cost). The pump capacity
      is fixed at 2.2 acft/day with a capital cost (if it is built) of $8,000/year and operating
      cost of $20/acft.
